        <p class="blog1">At the starting stage of my website
            I had few difficulties but i eventually
            got a starting point and i got the fundamentals
            such as getting all the pages to link to each other
            as well as get a background image and other necessary grid
            layouts to help me organise my website structure. This screenshot
            shows that part of the work.

        <p class="blog2">This part of the stage is where# i added content to
            the website and organised the margins and aligned it 
            all in a perfect way. I also added a form that allows
            the user to send a email to the website owner through
            the mail app that the submit button redirects them. The screenshot represents the Portfolio
            page where i was creating the columns.

        <p class="blog3">This part is where i got all my contents 
            and other necessary information for my website. Mobile 
            optimisation has been done at this stage of the
            assignment and right now there are only few bugs that
            needs to be looked into. The screenshot shows my mobile 
            css in the early stage of its work.
