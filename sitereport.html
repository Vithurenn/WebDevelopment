    <p>My experience on learning web has been great!. I have had ups and down over the period of this term when making the website 
        that will be detailed below, but has a overall perspective i have learned a 
        lot from this course.</p>
        
        <p>The background i chose for this website is very dark grey with font colour "white" and the reason i have chosen these colours
            is to have a simple but a neat look. By having dark grey and white font makes it bold and stands out to all audiences. There is
            no particular theme to attract a particular audience, this is a advnatage behind my overall website because anyone can come to this
            website and they wont be shown anything outsanding but just something simple to process.   
            
        </p>

        <p>Index validation:</p>
        
        <p><img src="Images/Index.jpg" alt="Index"></p>


    <p>When i first started the website project i had some dificulty starting the project. </p>

    <img src="Images/Evidence.jpg" alt="Evidence">
    <p>As you can see from the image i started making some changes to my website at the begining but
        had dificulty syncing it with github and had fatal errors as a consequence and had to start fresh again,
        this was a valuable lesson i learned and afterwards knew how guthub worked and how to fully commit code on 
        to the website.
